# CS CZ Map Installer

A simple, cross-platform GUI app that installs maps in Counter Strike/Counter
Strike: Condition Zero games, written in Python using
[PySide 1.2.4][pyside].

## Beta

Note that CS CZ Map Installer is still in beta, which means you should expect
bugs and not blame me if it blows up your computer. :3

## Usage

You can either run from source, or use one of the compiled executables in the
"Releases" tab on this page (currently executables are available only for
Windows and 64-bit GNU/Linux platforms).

To run from source, just download the source using git, then cd into the
directory and run `./main.py` (or `main.py` if you're using Windows).
Make sure you have [Python 3.4.3][python3.4.3] and [PySide 1.2.4][pyside]
installed.
